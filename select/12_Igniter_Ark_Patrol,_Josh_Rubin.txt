Another day that I've watch you,
Wish I could take you fate,
'Coz I'm your guide in all this darkness,
Been locked to your flames we burn walk away.

Don't look back,
It's you and me toghter,
I could stand for ever.

Don't look back,
You don't have to come back,
We can make no world.

Another day I've been broken,
fellt depart when the future looks so great.

I hope you understand,
When the worlds are closing in,
we can make it if you take my hand.

Don't look back,
It's you and me toghter.

Don't look back,
You don't have to come back,
We can make no worlds(?¿)
